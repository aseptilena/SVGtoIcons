SVGtoIcons
==========

Basic script to convert SVG files into icons and launch images for iOS (extendable to other things). This is quick and dirty and starting from blank non-functional project.

This project is inspired by [this blog post](http://throwachair.com/2013/10/26/generate-all-your-ios-app-icons-with-svg-and-inkscape/) although the plan is to add additional complexity.

Please also see [my blog post](http://blog.human-friendly.com/useful-svg-to-ios-icons-tip-using-inkscape).

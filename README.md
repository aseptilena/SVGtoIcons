SVGtoIcons
==========

Basic script to convert SVG files into icons and launch images for iOS (extendable to other things). This is quick and dirty and starting from blank non-functional project.

This project is inspired by [this blog post](http://throwachair.com/2013/10/26/generate-all-your-ios-app-icons-with-svg-and-inkscape/) although the plan is to add additional complexity.

Please also see [my blog post](http://blog.human-friendly.com/useful-svg-to-ios-icons-tip-using-inkscape).

No license is granted at this time except the fork and read default Github conditions for public repos. Contact me if you want to use it, I'll probably allow it but I'm not ready to commit to a free license at this time.
